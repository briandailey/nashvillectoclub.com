        <h2>What is the Nashville CTO Club?</h2>

        <p>The Nashville CTO Club is an invitation-only professional development and networking group for CTOs, VPs of
            Engineering, or other heads of engineering departments at growth companies.</p>

        <p>Our mission is to accelerate the professional development of software engineering leadership through
            structured learning, networking, and other activities. We envision regular high-quality meetings and
            services, with a goal of having 30-60 engaged members in the long term. The group values continuous
            learning, collaborative problem-solving, strong professional networks, community impact, and social
            engagement among its members.</p>

        <p>The club plans to have monthly meetings that include member updates, prepared presentations on relevant
            topics, and structured discussions. </p>

        <h2>Who is it for?</h2>

        <p>The CTO club is for technology leaders from growth-oriented companies who are actively building and leading
            teams. Members will engage in regular, meaningful participation and contribute valuable insights while
            collaborating with peers to address leadership challenges in growing tech organizations. Membership will be
            selective, focusing on leaders from companies with at least 15-20 engineers, $20M+ valuation with a goal
